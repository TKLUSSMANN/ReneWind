# ReneWind

"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. The objective was to build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that would help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators could be brought down.

**Key Skills**: 
Up and downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter tuning, Model Tuning
